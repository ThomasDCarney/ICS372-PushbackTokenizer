# ICS372-PushbackTokenizer
A program to break down and move either direction through a string.

# Purpose
This program is to illustrate the use of the "Adapter" design pattern. Where we used the existing functionality of a StringTokenizer and Stack to implement the PushbackableTokenizer interface.

Another simple example but provide the PushbackTokenizer with a string and you can traverse it in either direction via the interface methods.
